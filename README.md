# ‚ö°Ô∏è Simple Pokemon Battle Game ‚ö°Ô∏è

A nostalgic, turn-based Pokemon battle game built with Pygame and leveraging the PokeAPI! Relive your favorite moments from the classic Red/Blue era with a straightforward yet engaging battle system.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Choose Your Starter Pokemon:** Select from the iconic trio: Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle.
* **Dynamic Battles:** Experience turn-based combat against a rival, complete with attack animations and HP tracking.
* **Authentic Moves:** Pokemon moves are fetched directly from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), ensuring accurate power and type information (specifically from the Red-Blue version for a classic feel).
* **Potion Usage:** Strategically heal your Pokemon with a limited supply of potions.
* **API Integration:** Demonstrates fetching and utilizing data from a public API to populate game elements like Pokemon stats, types, and moves.
* **Pygame Fundamentals:** A great example of using Pygame for:
    * Sprite handling and scaling
    * Event detection (keyboard and mouse)
    * Drawing shapes and text
    * Basic game state management

## üéÆ How to Play

1.  **Select Your Pokemon:** At the start, click on your desired starter Pokemon (Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle).

5.  **Fainting:** The battle continues until one Pokemon's HP drops to zero.
6.  **Play Again?** After a battle, you'll be prompted to play again. Press 'Y' to restart or 'N' to quit.
